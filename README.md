# [FanDuel-Web](https://kihaen.github.io/fanduel-web/)

created using Create React App , available live!

The application is used to demonstrate the implementation/ integration of widely used libraries such as redux / thunk and 
axios to show good coding practices in the application and to come as close to production ready as possible.

I realize that using redux for such a application is overkill, but I also wanted to create something i could possibly use in the future for much more complex tasks.

* `npm start`
* `npm test`
* `npm run build`
* `npm run eject`
